```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)



```

## Creating the data set

The data set is part of the data base of the European Union of statistics explained. 
You can access the information in the web page : https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/data/database. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./stastistics.png')
```



## The shiny app

THe basic idea of the app is to include interactive  map that allows to the user to see the relative  energy consumption per country from 2009 to 2018.
Additionally, the app shows the values of all the countries in a table. 

    To include a interactive map is neccessary to use the R code in the server:

          output$mymap <- renderLeaflet({  })

and in the iu.R 

    leafletOutput("mymap")

The calculate the sized circles for the energy comsumption by: 

    addCircles(weight = 1, radius = energy_sub()[,2]/2)

## Funcionality of the app


- The user can select one of the years between 2009 and 2018. 

- The gross energy comsumption can be visualized in the map

- In the additional table, the values for each country can be consulted

- the table allows to the user to filter by country name and find the specific energy value
